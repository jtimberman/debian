         you do at least ONE of the following:
    
           a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
              make them Freely Available, such as by posting said

        the author to include your modifications in the software.
    
           b) use the modified software only within your corporation or
              organization.
    
           c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
        with standard executables, which must also be provided.
    
           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.
    
      3. You may distribute the software in object code or executable

        the software.

      4. You may modify and include the part of the software into any other
