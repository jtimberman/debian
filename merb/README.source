This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

See /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for a detailed explanation.

The upstream source has also been modified to remove gems from the 
specs, as the distributability is not confirmed for the gems. As
a result, the spec tests for Merb will not work straight from the source
tarball. These gems do not affect the outcome of the built package. The 
following were removed:

./merb-core/spec/public/core_ext/fixtures/gems/gems
  bad_require_gem-0.0.1/
  json_pure-1.1.3/
  simple_gem-0.0.1/
  simple_gem-0.0.2/
./merb-core/spec10/public/core_ext/fixtures/gems/gems
  bad_require_gem-0.0.1/
  json_pure-1.1.3/
  simple_gem-0.0.1/
  simple_gem-0.0.2/
./merb-core/spec10/public/webrat/test_app/gems/gems
  abstract-1.0.0/
  cgi_multipart_eof_fix-2.5.0/
  daemons-1.0.10/
  erubis-2.6.2/
  extlib-0.9.8/
  fastthread-1.0.1/
  gem_plugin-0.2.3/
  json_pure-1.1.3/
  merb-core-0.9.14/
  merb-helpers-0.9.14/
  mime-types-1.15/
  mongrel-1.1.5/
  rack-0.4.0/
  rake-0.8.3/
  rspec-1.1.11/
  thor-0.9.8/

These gems would need to be manually retrieved and installed to the
merb-core directories in order to run the spec tests.
