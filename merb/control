Description: Plugin library for Merb that provides access to libhaml-ruby
 Haml (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) is a layer on top of XHTML or

 closing tags and allowing Ruby to be embedded with ease. It was originally
 envisioned as a plugin for Ruby on Rails, but it can function as a 
 stand-alone templating engine.
