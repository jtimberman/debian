./merb-core/tools/allison-2.0.2:
    Merb incorporates the allison library.

    allison is Copyright 2007 Cloudburst, LLC and is licensed under
    the Academic Free License v.3.0.

    Academic Free License (AFL) v. 3.0

    This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work
    of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has
    placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice
    for the Original Work:

    Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0

    1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of
    the copyright, to do the following:

    a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of
    a collective work;

    b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the
    Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works")
    based upon the Original Work;

    c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
    Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that
    does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's
    reserved rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;

    d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

    e) to display the Original Work publicly.

    2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims
    owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
    Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
    and Derivative Works.

    3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
    preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
    all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work.
    Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of
    the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that
    Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
    obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an
    information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
    convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute
    the Original Work.

    4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
    names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
    trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products
    derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the
    Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License
    grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
    secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted
    to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of
    any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.
    No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks
    are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different
    from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a
    right to license.

    5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
    distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works
    in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used
    by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or
    communicated to those persons or made available as an application
    intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants
    of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of
    the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section
    1(c).

    6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
    Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
    notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
    notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
    "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
    Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably
    calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original
    Work.

    7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants
    that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
    granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed
    to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the
    contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
    expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original
    Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
    WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the
    warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a
    particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
    WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
    part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this
    License except under this disclaimer.

    8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
    theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or the use of the Original Work including,
    without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
    or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent
    applicable law prohibits such limitation.

    9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented
    to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable
    acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You
    distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative
    Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
    obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.
    This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed
    in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon
    the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
    conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
    Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
    limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall
    terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
    granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions
    in Section 1(c).

    10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
    to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging
    that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision
    shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by
    combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

    11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
    to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
    wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary
    business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
    conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
    excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License
    or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
    penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction.
    This section shall survive the termination of this License.

    12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License
    or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
    limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection
    with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section
    shall survive the termination of this License.

    13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.

    14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License,
    whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
    License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is
    controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this
    definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause
    the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
    otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
    Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses
    by You.

    16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2005
    Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or
    communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License
    permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to
    Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and
    copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the "Modified
    License") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to
    the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your
    Modified License is the "Academic Free License" or "AFL" and you may not
    use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must
    replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the
    notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice
    of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this
    License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
    source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open
    Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and
    certification process.

         original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

      2. You may modify your copy of the software in any way, provided that
         you do at least ONE of the following:

           a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
              make them Freely Available, such as by posting said

              the author to include your modifications in the software.

           b) use the modified software only within your corporation or
              organization.

           c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
              with standard executables, which must also be provided.

           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.

      3. You may distribute the software in object code or executable
         form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

           a) distribute the executables and library files of the software,

         files under the ./missing directory.  See each file for the copying
         condition.

      5. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
         output from the software do not automatically fall under the
